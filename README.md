# code-refactor
Added a title for when you click of the page.
I added alt and title to all images.
I got rid of a lot of useless css for the images and changed it into one class called menu-detail img and menu detail h2 to make it look easier to read so there isnt 9 different ones.
Moved a and p to the top of the css because it was at the bottom when those are very general.
Moved menu further up on the css.
Got rid of more css for the benifits and labeled it benifit-detail h3 and benifit-detail img.
moved unused p text into one thing for p.
